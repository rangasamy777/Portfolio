Welcome to my Portfolio

This is a list of projects which I have worked on in the past in my own time. Some of these have gone onto published onto the app store, used for dissertation project or submitted as coursework. 

I have achieved 1st class honours throughout my University life (graduating 11th July), with Deans awards for academic excellence both years also.
